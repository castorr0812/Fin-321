Stage 5 – Final Analysis & Recommendation
FX Hedging Analysis for EUR Receivable
Prepared by: Connor Storr
Date: December 12, 2025
A. Exposure Summary
The firm expects to receive €12,500,000 in 360 days, creating significant FX exposure. Because revenue is ultimately reported and utilized in USD, fluctuations in the EUR/USD exchange rate directly affect cash flow, margins, and budget accuracy.
A EUR depreciation reduces USD proceeds and threatens financial stability. A EUR appreciation, while beneficial, cannot be relied upon for planning or forecasting. Management requires a structured hedge strategy to protect USD-denominated cash flows while balancing cost, optionality, and liquidity.
B. Summary of Hedge Outcomes (from Stage 4 Model)
Strategy	Outcome
Forward Hedge	Locks in ~USD 13.64M, providing full certainty
Money Market Hedge	~USD 13.64M, nearly identical due to interest rate parity
Put Option	Guarantees a minimum USD inflow; upside preserved but premiums reduce net proceeds
Call Option	Only beneficial if EUR appreciates materially; exposes firm to downside and premium costs
Unhedged	Highly sensitive: swings ±5% with EUR movement
Key insight:
The forward and MM hedges converge to nearly identical USD proceeds, reflecting interest rate parity.
Options introduce curvature — asymmetric payoffs not possible with forwards or money market hedges.
C. Sensitivity Interpretation
1. EUR Depreciation Scenario (Sₜ = 0.95 × S₀)
Unhedged exposure experiences the largest USD decline.
Forward/MM hedges remain fully insulated.
Put hedge outperforms all strategies during depreciation because intrinsic value increases.
Call hedge performs poorly (no payoff + premium cost).
2. EUR Appreciation Scenario (Sₜ = 1.05 × S₀)
Unhedged achieves maximum upside.
Forward/MM do not benefit from appreciation (fixed rate).
Put hedge retains upside (minus premium).
Call hedge becomes profitable and competitive with unhedged results.
Interpretation:
Forwards/MM → best for certainty and risk elimination
Puts → best for downside protection + upside participation
Calls → speculative; not ideal for receivable hedging
D. Strategic Recommendation
Recommended Strategy: Forward Hedge (primary) + Opportunistic Put Hedge (conditional)
Why this combination works:
Forward hedge provides full cash flow certainty at ~USD 13.64M, aligning with treasury risk policies and budget goals.
Put options may be layered on a small notional (<20%) if management wishes to retain upside exposure while capping worst-case outcomes.
If only one strategy can be selected:
   -Choose the Forward Hedge-
It best matches the firm’s risk profile, liquidity needs, and earnings predictability requirements.
E. Executive Justification
1. Cash Flow Stability
The forward hedge eliminates FX volatility, supporting reliable budgeting and forecasting.
2. Liquidity & Cost
Money market hedging requires borrowing and lending flows; the forward hedge achieves the same economics with zero upfront cash.
Options require premium payments that reduce operating cash flow.
3. Optionality
Puts offer strategic flexibility but introduce premium cost and lower expected value relative to a forward. A partial-put overlay could balance optionality with certainty.
4. Governance & Control
Forward and MM hedges are straightforward, auditable, and align with treasury policy standards.
