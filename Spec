## Purpose  
Provide a professional, quantitative specification outlining the analytical structure for evaluating FX hedging alternatives for a euro-denominated receivable.

---

## 1. Problem Statement  

Our firm expects to receive **€ 4,500,000 in twelve months** from a European customer for exports priced in euros. This creates a **foreign-exchange exposure** in which the company is **long EUR / short USD**.

At today’s **spot rate** of **1.1619 USD/EUR**, the receivable is worth approximately **\$ 5.23 million**. However, the **one-year forward rate** of **1.0875 USD/EUR** implies potential euro depreciation, reducing the dollar proceeds to roughly **\$ 4.89 million**—a projected decline of about **\$ 340 k**.

**Objective:** Protect the USD value of the euro receivable while maintaining flexibility to benefit from euro appreciation.  
**Decision Context:** This framework supports the Corporate Treasury team in comparing **forward, money-market, and option hedges** to stabilize USD cash flows.

## 2. Inputs (Known Variables)

| Variable | Description | Unit | Example / Value | Source |
|-----------|--------------|------|-----------------|---------|
| `FC_AMT` | Foreign-currency receivable | EUR | 4,500,000 | Sales contract |
| `S₀` | Current EUR/USD spot rate | USD/EUR | 1.1619 | Market data |
| `F₀` | 1-year EUR/USD forward rate | USD/EUR | 1.0875 | Dealer quote |
| `r_USD` | USD 1-year interest rate | % p.a. | 4.25 % | Fed funds rate |
| `r_EUR` | EUR 1-year interest rate | % p.a. | 3.10 % | ECB deposit rate |
| `t` | Time to maturity | Years | 1.0 | Contract |
| `K_put` | EUR put (sell EUR) strike | USD/EUR | 1.15 | Analyst set |
| `K_call` | EUR call (buy EUR) strike | USD/EUR | 1.20 | Analyst set |
| `Premium_put` | Put premium | USD/EUR | 0.036 | Dealer quote |
| `Premium_call` | Call premium | USD/EUR | 0.048 | Dealer quote |
| `t_txn` | Transaction cost per leg | % of notional | 0.10 % | Assumption |
| `Scenarios` | Spot-rate change range | % change | −10 %, 0 %, +10 % | Scenario design |

> **Tip:** These variable names should be reused directly as named ranges or prompt parameters in Stage 3.

## 3. Assumptions & Constraints  

- Interest rates quoted on a **simple annual (360-day)** basis.  
- Forward rate represents a **1-year maturity contract**.  
- Settlement occurs exactly 12 months after the valuation date.  
- **No credit or counterparty risk** assumed.  
- Transaction costs of **0.10 % per FX leg** included symmetrically.  
- Exchange rates expressed as **USD per EUR**.  
- Option premiums are **paid upfront in USD**.  
- Taxes, hedge accounting, and basis spreads are excluded.  
- All outputs reported in **USD** for consistency.

These conventions ensure full reproducibility by another treasury analyst.

## 4. Calculation Flow  

The model computes USD receipts under each hedge type in the following sequence:

### **A. Forward Hedge**
1. Lock in conversion at `F₀`.  
2. Compute USD proceeds:

   ```text
   USD_forward = FC_AMT × F₀ × (1 – t_txn)
Record guaranteed USD inflow at maturity.

B. Money-Market Hedge
Borrow euros today equal to the PV of the receivable:
PV_EUR = FC_AMT / (1 + r_EUR × t)
Convert to USD at spot S₀.
Invest USD proceeds at r_USD for t years.
At maturity, repay euro loan using receivable.
USD investment maturity value represents hedged proceeds.

C. Option Hedge
Select strike prices K_put, K_call.
Compute premium cost:
Premium_cost = Premium × FC_AMT
At maturity:
If S_T < K_put → exercise put → receive FC_AMT × K_put.
If S_T > K_put → let expire → receive FC_AMT × S_T.
Net USD proceeds:
USD_option = (FC_AMT × Effective_Rate) – Premium_cost
Generate payoff diagram vs. spot-rate scenarios.

D. Comparative Evaluation
Tabulate USD results for all hedge types and the unhedged case.
Compute % deviation from unhedged value and expected USD variance.
Summarize trade-offs: certainty (forward/MM) vs. optionality (options).

** 5.Outputs
Output	Description	Format	Purpose
USD_unhedged	Projected USD value using expected spot	Numeric	Baseline comparison
USD_forward	USD proceeds from forward hedge	Numeric	Certainty benchmark
USD_mm	USD proceeds from money-market hedge	Numeric	Cross-check vs. forward
USD_option	Net USD receipts after option premium	Table / chart	Flexibility analysis
Chart_1	USD receipts vs. spot rate	Line chart	Visual hedge comparison
Chart_2	Sensitivity tornado chart	Bar chart	FX-impact visualization
Summary	Executive-ready conclusion	Text	CFO decision support
Outputs will form the foundation of a professional treasury dashboard.

6. Sensitivity Plan
Variable tested: Future spot rate S_T.
Range: 0.90 × S₀ → 1.10 × S₀ in 0.01 increments.
Process:
Recalculate USD proceeds for each hedge under every S_T.
Present results in a comparison table and line chart.
Metrics: Expected USD value, standard deviation, min/max, and 95 % VaR.
Visualization:
Line chart of USD proceeds vs. S_T.
Data-table sensitivity for scenario analysis.

7. Limitations & Next Steps
Limitations
No modeling of credit, liquidity, or counterparty risk.
Interest rates and volatility treated as static.
Transaction costs simplified to a flat rate.
Option values not derived from Black-Scholes; market quotes assumed.
Taxes and accounting implications excluded.
