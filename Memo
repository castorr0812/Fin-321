Subject: Managing FX Exposure for €12.5 Million Receivable
Executive Summary 
Our firm expects to receive €12.5 million in one year from a European client. With the current spot rate at 1.1632 USD/EUR and the 1-year forward rate at 1.0910 USD/EUR, the euro is trading at a forward discount. This implies potential dollar receipts could fall from $14.54 million to $13.64 million, a projected loss of approximately $900,000 due solely to exchange rate movement. To mitigate this exposure, three hedging strategies—forward contract, money market hedge, and currency option—were analyzed using an Excel-based quantitative model. Each strategy stabilizes future cash flows, but with different cost and flexibility trade-offs. The recommended action is to execute a 1-year forward contract to lock in USD proceeds and eliminate FX uncertainty.
Background & Objectives
The company faces foreign exchange transaction exposure due to its euro-denominated receivable. As a U.S.-based firm reporting in USD, any depreciation in the euro directly reduces the realized dollar value of incoming cash flows. Given interest rate differentials and euro-area inflation risks, the EUR/USD forward curve indicates expected euro weakness.
Objectives:
1. Quantify FX risk associated with the €12.5 million receivable under multiple spot rate scenarios.
2. Compare the cost, risk reduction, and flexibility of three hedge strategies.
3. Recommend a financially optimal and operationally practical hedge for execution.
Methods
An Excel-based FX hedging model was developed to project USD outcomes across spot rates from 1.00 to 1.25 EUR/USD. The model incorporated current market data: Spot rate (1.1632), Forward rate (1.0910), USD interest rate (4.11%), EUR interest rate (2.15%), Put option strike (1.1632), and Put premium ($0.017 per EUR).
Three hedging strategies were evaluated:
• Forward Contract: Sell €12.5M forward at 1.0910, locking in $13,637,500 of proceeds. Eliminates risk but foregoes upside if the euro strengthens.
• Money Market Hedge: Borrow the present value of €12.5M discounted at 2.15%, convert to USD at spot (1.1632), and invest the USD at 4.11% for one year. Produces nearly identical results to the forward (≈$13.72M) but requires credit capacity and balance sheet management.
• Option Hedge (EUR Put): Buy a EUR put at 1.1632 for $0.017/€, total premium $212,500. This guarantees a minimum USD rate if EUR weakens while retaining upside potential if EUR appreciates.
Limitations & Next Steps
Assumptions:
• Constant interest rates and stable option premiums over the hedge horizon.
• Excludes transaction fees, liquidity risk, and counterparty credit considerations.
• Based on current market conditions as of October 24, 2025.
Next Steps:
1. Finalize the Excel model with integrated payoff charts comparing all hedge outcomes.
2. Present findings to the CFO and treasury committee for hedge selection.
3. Execute the chosen hedge strategy (forward or option) with approved counterparties.
4. Document hedge accounting treatment per ASC 815 standards.
